Zwift leverages the power of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and TLS Oracles to create a trustless environment for buying and selling cryptocurrencies. This platform is designed to minimize trust in traditional exchanges by allowing direct, secure, and private transactions between users.

## Objectives

- Develop an MVP for trustless onboarding to an Ethereum L2 solution.
- Prototype a privacy-preserving P2P Automated Market Maker (AMM).
- Optimize SNARK-based TLS Oracles for enhanced performance.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Zwift project:

### How to Start

1. Run the setup script to install dependencies and configure the environment.
    ```sh
    ./setup_project.sh
    ```
2. Integrate the local Anvil chain into your MetaMask wallet for easy interaction with your local development environment.
3. Pick one private key from the local Ethereum blockchain generated by your local environment.
4. Integrate the selected private key into your MetaMask wallet to interact with the deployed contracts.

## Usage

After installation, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application in the browser. The platform allows you to register as a seller or buyer to engage in cryptocurrency transactions secured by ZKPs and TLS Oracles.
